| [VS Code Agent Mode Just Changed Everything](https://youtu.be/dutyOc_cAEU?t=19) | Getting Started | Ever wished your code editor could write your app, talk to your database, and even follow documentation like a real dev? In this video, we show you how to use agent mode, MCP Servers and PRD documents to build an entire app complete with database. |
| [The Future of AI in VS Code: MCP Servers Explained!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp0p7iKH6ho) | Getting Started | In this video, we break down MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers and how they supercharge GitHub Copilot inside Visual Studio Code. Learn how to set up and use MCP servers to bring live, real-time context‚Äîlike web searches and databases‚Äîdirectly into your AI coding workflow. |
| [Build Remote MCP servers using Azure Functions in C# and .NET](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Build+Remote+MCP+servers+using+Azure+Functions+in+C%23+and+.NET) | Getting Started | Deploy MCP Servers with Azure Functions and .NET |
| [Build Remote MCP servers using Azure Functions in C# and TypeScript](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Build+Remote+MCP+servers+using+Azure+Functions+in+C%23+and+TypeScript) | Getting Started | Deploy MCP Servers with Azure Functions and TypeScript |
| [Use APIs as tools for your Agents with MCP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xf5xxhT9ySs) | Getting Started | Learn how to use APIs as tools within your MCP agents |
| [This Protocol will Transform My Linux Lab](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=This+Protocol+will+Transform+My+Linux+Lab) | Getting Started | Cloud Engineer/Ops focused implementation of MCP |
| [Model context Protocol + Aspire = AI Magic in .NET](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2holzbob1_I&t=138s) | Getting Started | In this video, we walk you through how to integrate the Model Context Protocol (MCP) into a Blazor Chat Application powered by .NET Aspire using the official C# SDK. üöÄ The official C# SDK makes it easy to implement and interact with MCP clients and servers in your .NET apps. In this demo, we‚Äôll see how to create a Blazor-based chat app, configure MCP, and connect it to a local AI model using Qwq ‚Äî all managed by .NET Aspire! |
| [Microsoft Copilot Studio ‚ù§Ô∏è Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG-XTzXxFCk) | Getting Started | In this video, Power Platform Advocate, Daniel Laskewitz walks you through the brand-new Microsoft Copilot Studio ‚ù§Ô∏è Model Context Protocol (MCP) Lab! Learn how Model Context Protocol (MCP) empowers makers to seamlessly connect external knowledge sources and APIs to their Copilot Studio agents. MCP actions and knowledge automatically stay updated as functionality evolves ‚Äî making your agents smarter and more adaptable. |
